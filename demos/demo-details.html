I almost went back inside when something on this huge palm tree leaf caught my eye. I stayed around and it was this little gecko, startled by my presence he was hidden between the ridges of the leaf. He would pop his head up periodically to check his surroundings, as soon as he saw i was still there he would hide again. We played this game for a while until i got the shot.

        <p>In this demo, we will make use of two GalleryView features, the ability to set custom thumbnail images and the addition of informational overlays. To set a custom image for the filmstrip's 'frame' elements, we add a <code>data-frame</code> attribute to our image tags. To add a title and description to the image, we utilize the <code>title</code> attribute and a <code>data-description</code> attribute.</p>
        <code><pre>&lt;img data-frame="img/photos/crops/bp1.jpg" src="img/photos/bp1.jpg" title="Lone Tree Yellowstone" data-description="A solitary tree surviving another harsh winter in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. (Photo and caption by Anita Erdmann/Nature/National Geographic Photo Contest)"&gt;</pre></code>
        <p>We must also enable panel overlays via the appropriate plugin option:</p>
        <code><pre>$('#myGallery').galleryView({
    enable_overlays: true
});</pre></code>
