I almost went back inside when something on this huge palm tree leaf caught my eye. I stayed around and it was this little gecko, startled by my presence he was hidden between the ridges of the leaf. He would pop his head up periodically to check his surroundings, as soon as he saw i was still there he would hide again. We played this game for a while until i got the shot.

These geckos were living all around the hale' we were staying in, enjoying the noni and basking on the railing and sunny steps to our place.

        <p>This demo illustrates how both the filmstrip and informational overlays can be moved to suit the needs of the user. The filmstrip can be placed on any of the gallery's four sides. Also note that for vertical filmstrips, the navigation buttons will arrange themselves vertically, depending on the width of the filmstrip frames. The overlays can be placed on the bottom or top of the panel. This demo also shows off another panel animation style, crossfading between images.</p>
        <code><pre>$('#myGallery').galleryView({
    filmstrip_position: 'right',
    enable_overlays: true,
    overlay_position: 'top',
    panel_animation: 'crossfade'
});</pre></code>
